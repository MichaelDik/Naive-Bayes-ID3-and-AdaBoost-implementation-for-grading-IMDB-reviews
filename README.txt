#Programming Language : Python

#Unzip the folder:
1)find the downloaded zip folder (e.g. 3180010_3180050_3180076.zip)
2)unzip the files in whichever folder you want

#Include aclImdb folder
1) Assignment's instructions request not to send reviews' data along with our code,
    so user has to put aclImdb folder in the same directory with main.py (and the rest 
    of code files)

#Compile and execute:
1)open cmd window
2)change directory to that where main.py is.
   e.g. cd C:\Users\some_user\Downloads\3180010_3180050_3180076
3)type in the cmd window: python main.py
4)choose from the menu options (int numbers or characters) to see every 
   functionality.
